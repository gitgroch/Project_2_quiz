## **Planning** 

I discovered early on this project had many moving parts that became difficult to track, I decided to use Trello to track the tasks that I neeeded to complete

### **WireFraming** 

I used Balsamiq to roughly plan out some of the initial features and layout of the pages. Desktop and Mobile versions were wireframed side by side which helped me to decide early on how I wanted to approach responsiveness. On the whole, there are many parts of the final design that departs significantly from the wireframes, but the structure is similar.

### **Color Schemes** 

I looked for a color scheme that would be consistent with a Sci-Fi movie poster or book cover. 

I used the tool [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) to generate several color schemes until I arrived at something that met my criteria:

### **Typography**

I looked for fonts that again would be consistent with a Sci-Fi movie poster or book cover. 
**Fonts:**
- For Headers: [Unica One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Unica+One?query=unica+one)
- For Body text: [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?query=comfortaa)
- Backup font: Sans Serif

The fonts are sourced from Google fonts.

### Tutorials 

The below tutorials by Brian Design and Web Dev Simplified are the main inspiration and source of information for my JavaScript Code. As the application is relatively simple, some of the code is used almost verbatim from these tutorials. I have tried to use notation to display how it fits into my application.
